# What is Consensus Referendum on Crypto Privacy?


We launched the "Law-Making" Campaign of the Crypto World in October 2022. We believe decentralization does not equal chaos, much less a breeding ground for crime and greed. The crypto world needs order urgently. Rules are the foundation of a legal order. Rules of the Crypto World should be Bottom-up made, derived from the consensus of crypto citizens, instead of imposed by traditional states. We believe that **"Consensus is Law."** Code might be the law, but the coder alone has no authority in law-making. Democracy is the foundation of any law. **We want to unite the entire crypto world to make the law of Web3, by Web3, and for Web3.**

The Tornado Cash Sanction has raised legal questions about blockchain privacy. The traditional regulatory system has not answered those questions and also inspired us. We decided to initiate our first law-making campaign on privacy law.

**We will host a referendum that opens to all crypto citizens. We want to put the "trickiest" questions of crypto privacy law in front of crypto citizens to let them decide and establish this native legal order.** Since November, 2022, a research group (more than 40 members) on crypto privacy law has been formed within LegalDAO. Through academic research and seminar hosting, we have selected more than 30 crypto privacy law questions, such as: what legal form should privacy service providers take; what is the "boundary" of on-chain data privacy; who should be accountable, etc. These questions will be presented so that any crypto citizen can easily understand and express their opinion, with sufficient supporting material for reference. We will also invite crypto projects/companies/law firms/organizations to come and vote. As of now, we have more than 50 partners.

**After gathering consensus, LegalDAO members will edit, codify and publish the final "Law."** We hope this attempt can benefit every participant in the crypto world. We might be able to standardize or codify the "Law" to help establish an industrial self-discipline mechanism or provide low-cost compliance methods for crypto projects. We might also lead traditional regulations in a direction that is in the best interests of the Crypto World. But that all depends on how strong our consensus is.


# Our Proposed Framework

## Section Ⅰ Privacy Protection on Blockchain

- The definition of data subjects and their inherent rights (specifically, right to protect privacy and personal information by seeking privacy services);
- The classification of privacy on blockchain;
- The contour of privacy and personal information that should be protected in the context of blockchain;
- The definition of data controllers, collectors, and processors, and their respective obligations in the context of blockchain; and,
- The appropriate way to inform data subjects of their rights and risks when involved in on-chain activities. 
 
## Section Ⅱ Guidelines for Privacy Service Providers
 
- Legal forms of privacy service providers (e.g. DAOs, smart contracts, companies, etc.), their respective obligations and potential risks under the existing regulatory framework; 
- A summary of existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, their legal risks pertaining to data protection, anti-money laundering, tax evasion, etc. (We will thoroughly examine regulations and law enforcement patterns in major jurisdictions to find a point of balance between high-level of privacy and regulatory requirements.); and,
- Technical and legal solutions to safeguard users' privacy while satisfying regulatory requirements.
 
## Section Ⅲ Recommendations and Policy Options
- A legal and risk assessment framework for blockchain privacy-preserving mechanisms; 
- The classification and grading of privacy tailored for on-chain activities.

# Our Selected Questions


Under our framework, we have selected some questions focusing on the following three sections:
- Crypto privacy: objects, scenarios and types
- Privacy protection for blockchain data
- Privacy-preserving tools/services

Here are them for your review: [Draft of Voting Questions](https://github.com/Legal-DAO/Consensus-Referendum-on-Crypto-Privacy/blob/main/Draft%20of%20Voting%20Question.md)

Each question consists of 3 parts:

> [the question]
>
> [choices]
>
> [background infomation]*
>
> *Here we shall provide necessary background information, and briefly elaborate on the covered technical or legal issues(around 500 characters), so that voters may better understand the question and realize the significance of them.
