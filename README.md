# Consensus-Referendum-on-Crypto-Privacy

We invite you to join this Consensus Referendum on Crypto Privacy Law. And here, we will give you a brief overview of what we are doing, how you may participate, and what we have already done so far.

## What shall we cover?

What exactly shall we cover in this Consensus Referendum? Due to the complexity of this agenda, we can't cover everything. And it's also beyond our capacity to go too deep into technical details, at least at the current stage. Thus, it's more accurate to say that we are formulating policies and principles, than to say that we are making executable rules.

And now, we have preliminarily divided it into the following three sections:

- Crypto privacy: objects, scenarios and types
- Privacy protection for blockchain data
- Privacy-preserving tools/services
